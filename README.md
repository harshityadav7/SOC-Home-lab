# SOC-Home-lab
In my ongoing SOC Home Lab project, Iâ€™ve been working on vulnerability scanning, malware analysis, and telemetry generation for enhanced threat detection.

I utilized Legion and Nmap to perform vulnerability scans, identifying open ports and weaknesses. After finding exploitable vulnerabilities, I launched an attack using Metasploit with a reverse TCP payload to gain shell access on the target machine. I also targeted the RDP port to gain remote access to a Windows device.

On the Windows machine, I had Sysmon configured to monitor system activities, and I used Splunk to capture and analyze the telemetry generated during the attack. This helped me detect malicious activities in real time.

Additionally, I analyzed various malware samples using GHIDRA for reverse engineering, gaining insights into how malware behaves and affects systems. As part of the project, I also developed a custom port scanner, allowing me to detect open services and vulnerabilities for further exploitation.

This project has been instrumental in improving my skills in attack detection, response, and malware analysis.
